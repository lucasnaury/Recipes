# Recipes
This app allows you to enter your recipes as well as search for other people's recipes.
It also has a special feature that shows you random recipes to choose from when you don't know what to cook.

It was built using HTML, CSS and JQ (jQuery) for the front-end and Google's Firebase back-end service.
